# MNIST [WIP]
Using tensorflow, I'm attacking to Kaggle leaderboard!

## Dataset
MNIST - Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database.

Handwriting numbers dataset for Machine Learning.

## What I did
I learned some basics of Tensorflow at [this site](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/quickstart/beginner)
Then I applied what I learned to kaggle competition.


## What to improve
- Model improvement

Using more layers, other method of evaluation function.
- Data augmentation

Shifting and rotating image.
